This project showcases what I have learned and how I have applied it.  
It includes HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and API integration.  

### Workflow:  
- **HTML**: Structuring the website, adding details such as the website title, menu, shopping cart, and other elements.  
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity and connecting to the API [https://dummyjson.com/products](https://dummyjson.com/products) (product catalog).  
- **CSS**: Styling the website, including a fixed navbar that stays in place while scrolling.  

Thank you for visiting! I will continue to learn and improve.
